CSE233 – Assignment 2 Answers

---------------------------------------

Exercise 1: fork() Program Explanation

This program demonstrates process creation in Linux using the fork() system call.
- fork() creates a child process that runs concurrently with the parent.
- If pid == 0  (the code is executing inside the child process)
- If pid > 0   (the code is executing inside the parent process)
- If pid == -1 (fork failed)

Each process prints its own PID using getpid(), showing that both parent and child are executing the same program but as separate processes.

---------------------------------------

Exercise 2: Running a Process in the Background

Command:
    sleep 300 &
The ampersand (&) tells the shell to run the process in the background, allowing the user to continue using the terminal.

---------------------------------------

Exercise 3: Stopping a Process

Commands:
    ps aux | grep sleep   (Find the process ID (PID))
    kill <PID>            (Terminates the process)
    ps aux | grep sleep   (Verify it has stopped)

---------------------------------------

Exercise 4: Pausing and Resuming a Process

Commands:
    kill -STOP <PID>  (Pauses the process)
    kill -CONT <PID>  (Resumes the process)

This demonstrates UNIX signals for process control.

---------------------------------------

Exercise 5: Role of the Linker

In the linker example:
- file1.c defines a function (hello()).
- file2.c calls that function inside main().

The linker combines both object files:
    gcc file1.c file2.c -o output_program

The linker resolves external symbols such as:
- The function defined in file1.c
- The reference to that function in file2.c

Without the linker, the program cannot be built.

Exercise 6: Role of the Loader

The loader is responsible for:
- Loading the compiled program into memory
- Mapping shared libraries dynamically
- Preparing the process for execution

Using:
    ldd simple_program
You can see which libraries are dynamically loaded, such as:
- libc.so
- ld-linux.so
